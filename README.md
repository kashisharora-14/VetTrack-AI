# 🐾 VetTrack AI - AI-Powered Pet Health Management System

A Flask-based AI web application that helps pet owners manage health more effectively with AI-driven analysis, photo diagnosis, smart tracking, and Murf-powered voice guidance.


## 💡 Inspiration:  
This project is deeply personal to me. I once had a pet who suffered from parvovirus.  
We didn’t have access to a professional vet in our city at the time, so he only received basic treatment without identifying the real issue.  
By the time we took him to a bigger hospital, it was too late to save him. Losing him was one of the hardest experiences, and it inspired me to build VetTrack AI — so that other pet owners can have faster access to health insights and never feel helpless in such moments.
